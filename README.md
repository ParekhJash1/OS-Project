🖨️ Smart Printer Process Scheduler
A Python-based Smart Printer Scheduler built with Tkinter GUI that simulates process scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, and Priority scheduling.

This project demonstrates how a printer (or any job queue) can manage multiple incoming tasks efficiently using basic CPU scheduling logic — displayed through a user-friendly interface.

🚀 Features
🧾 Add multiple print jobs with Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority

⚙️ Simulates First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling

📊 Displays results in a clean table view (Treeview)

📈 Calculates and shows:

Completion Time (CT)

Turnaround Time (TAT)

Waiting Time (WT)

📉 Shows average turnaround and waiting times in a popup

💡 Built with Tkinter (no extra installations needed)

🧠 How It Works
Enter process details → PID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority.

Click Add Process to add it to the queue.

Click Run Scheduler to simulate scheduling and view computed metrics instantly.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Tkinter for GUI

Treeview (ttk) for table display
