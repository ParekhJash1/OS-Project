External Libraries:

PyPDF2                #Used to open and read PDF files that the user uploads, and to count the number of pages. 

Tkinter               #Used to build the main GUI window, buttons (like Add Job, Start Printing), and layout for the user interface.



Built-in Libraries:

threading            #Allows the printing process to run in the background without freezing the interface.

time                 #Used to simulate the actual printing process, adding realistic pauses (for example, 1 second per page).

collections.deque    #Manages the print queue efficiently for FCFS, SJF, or other scheduling algorithms.

uuid                 #Generates a unique ID for each print job so every job can be tracked individually.

os                   #Used to manage file paths and verify the uploaded file’s existence before processing.

queue                #Helps manage communication between threads (for adding or removing print jobs safely).

tkinter.ttk          #Provides advanced, modern widgets like Treeview (for job tables), Progressbar, and styled buttons.

messagebox           #Displays pop-up messages like “Job Added Successfully” or “Error: No file selected.”

filedialog           #Opens the system’s file browser so the user can select a PDF to upload.
